# Contributing to rendseq

Help us make rendseq better!

***

## Instructions:

If you are planning to make a larger change (eg add a new feature please open an issue/add some comments so we know that you are working on it/we can provide feedback and make sure no one else is working on the same thing!)

Otherwise our workflow follows the general Github Work Flow, ie:
 * Make a new Fork of the rendseq repository
 * Add your changes
 * If needed - please add some new tests to test the change you made
 * Verify that your code doesn't break any pre-existing test cases
 * Make sure your code follows good style conventions.  We use PEP 8 style conventions.  We run [pylint](https://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/intro.html) on our code to verify compliance and request you do the same! 
 * Submit a pull request.
